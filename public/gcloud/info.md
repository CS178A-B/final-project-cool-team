### Info

> 1/27/21: Finally able to call Gcloud model. However, the files are kept in a separate container (GoormIDE) to mitigate automl package issues.
Working to modify script to fill csv with results from model.

#### Gcloud SDK setup 

These commands must be run everytime:

`source '/workspace/gcloud/google-cloud-sdk/path.bash.inc'`

`source '/workspace/gcloud/google-cloud-sdk/completion.bash.inc'`

`gcloud auth login`
